    "I have been reading \"Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data\" by Charles Wheelan (ISBN: 978-0-393-07195-5) and read a chapter that described the game show \"Let's Make a Deal\" from the 1980's. In the game, Monty Hall presents contestants with the option to win a prize behind 1 of 3 doors. Behind 1 of the doors is a great prize, like a car. Behind the two other doors is a valueless prize. When a contestant chooses a door (let's say door #1), Monty then reveals one of the other two doors that does not contain the major prize (let's say door #3) and then asks the contestant if they would like to stay with their original selection (door #1) or switch to the now unrevealed door #2. Intution might say that it makes no difference if you stay or switch, but statistically switching doubles your odds of winning (2/3 change of winning vs. 1/3 change of winning if you keep your original selection). The code below models the game while letting users change the number of doors and the number of random times the game is played. Let's check it out."
