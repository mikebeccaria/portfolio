# Portfolio
This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks and scripts I created for data analysis and exploration.

## SQL
**[AnAge Database of Animal Ageing and Longevity](https://github.com/mikebeccaria/portfolio/blob/main/Anage.sql)**:
This project explores the data of the Database of animal aging and logevity found here: https://genomics.senescence.info/species/index.html
I imported the data into a SQL database and made a few discoveries

**[Pregnancies, Births and Abortions in the United States](https://github.com/mikebeccaria/portfolio/blob/main/NationalAndStatePregnancy_PublicUse_Calcuations.sql)**:
A simple project dig into SQL a bit. This project explores data on pregnancies, births and abortions to discover which states had higher pregnancy rates for women under the age of 20 than the US average for years 2000-2017.

## Python/Pandas/etc.
**[The Central Limit Theorem test](https://github.com/mikebeccaria/portfolio/blob/main/central_limit_theorum.ipynb)**:
This project tests the Central Limit Theorem in statistics using a height/weight data set and subsamples to determine if it is reliable to use a subsample of data to extrapolate information about the greater data set. The Central Limit Theorem is used everywhere, but perhaps most notably in polling, and states "that if you have a population with mean μ and standard deviation σ and take sufficiently large random samples from the population with replacement , then the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed." Does it work? Let's explore.
