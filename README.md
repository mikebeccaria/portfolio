# Portfolio
This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks and scripts I created for data analysis and exploration.

## SQL
**[AnAge Database of Animal Ageing and Longevity](https://github.com/mikebeccaria/portfolio/blob/main/Anage.sql)**
This project explores the data of the Database of animal aging and logevity found here: https://genomics.senescence.info/species/index.html
I imported the data into a SQL database and made a few discoveries

**[Pregnancies, Births and Abortions in the United States] (https://osf.io/ndau2/)**
A simple project dig into SQL a bit. This project explores data on pregnancies, births and abortions to discover which states had higher pregnancy rates for women under the age of 20 than the US average for years 2000-2017.
